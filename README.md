# Peer-graded-Assignment-Final-Project-Submission<br>
The goal of this exercise is to create a product to highlight the prediction algorithm that you have built and to provide an interface that can be accessed by others.For this project you must submit:<br>
1.  A Shiny app that takes as input a phrase (multiple words) in a text box input and outputs a prediction of the next word.<br>
2.  A slide deck consisting of no more than 5 slides created with R Studio Presenter (https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486468-Authoring-R-Presentations) pitching your algorithm and app as if you were presenting to your boss or an investor.<br>

Review criteria<br>

Data Product<br>
1.  Does the link lead to a Shiny app with a text input box that is running on shinyapps.io?<br>
2.  Does the app load to the point where it can accept input?<br>
3.  When you type a phrase in the input box do you get a prediction of a single word after pressing submit and/or a suitable delay for the model to compute the answer?<br>
4.  Put five phrases drawn from Twitter or news articles in English leaving out the last word. Did it give a prediction for every one?<br>

Slide Deck<br>
1.  Does the link lead to a 5 slide deck on R Pubs?<br>
2.  Does the slide deck contain a description of the algorithm used to make the prediction?<br>
3.  Does the slide deck describe the app, give instructions, and describe how it functions?<br>
4.  How would you describe the experience of using this app?<br>
5.  Does the app present a novel approach and/or is particularly well done?<br>
6.  Would you hire this person for your own data science startup company?<br>

## Peer-graded Assignment: Milestone Report

The goal of this project is just to display that you've gotten used to working with the data and that you are on track to create your prediction algorithm. Please submit a report on R Pubs (
http://rpubs.com/
) that explains your exploratory analysis and your goals for the eventual app and algorithm. This document should be concise and explain only the major features of the data you have identified and briefly summarize your plans for creating the prediction algorithm and Shiny app in a way that would be understandable to a non-data scientist manager. You should make use of tables and plots to illustrate important summaries of the data set. The motivation for this project is to: 1. Demonstrate that you've downloaded the data and have successfully loaded it in.2. Create a basic report of summary statistics about the data sets.3. Report any interesting findings that you amassed so far.4. Get feedback on your plans for creating a prediction algorithm and Shiny app. 

Does the link lead to an HTML page describing the exploratory analysis of the training data set?

Has the data scientist done basic summaries of the three files? Word counts, line counts and basic data tables?

Has the data scientist made basic plots, such as histograms to illustrate features of the data?

Was the report written in a brief, concise style, in a way that a non-data scientist manager could appreciate?
